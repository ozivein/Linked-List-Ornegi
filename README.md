### Linked-List
**Here is the beginning of my data structures lesson**
- Create a one-way linked list of type String. According to the user's choice;
+ a-Add the imported data to the list.
* b-Delete from the list according to the index value.
+ c-Return the number of elements of the list.
+ d-Print the list in reverse.
+ e-Search the imported data in the list, as a result, the searched data is x in the list. Return the index value by saying it is in the order.
